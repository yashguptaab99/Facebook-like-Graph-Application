//					  graph to represent each node as a user and a link to represent the friend
//					  relationship between them. Store data such as date of birth, number of
//					  comments for each user.
//
// 					  1. Find who is having maximum friends
//					  2. Find who has post maximum and minimum comments
//					  3. Find users having birthday in this month
//
//					  Hint: (Use adjacency list representation and perform DFS and BFS
//					        traversals)
